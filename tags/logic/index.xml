      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, your grade school grammar teacher has scolded you at one point or
another for your inadvertent use of a double negative.  Statements such as “I
don’t know nothing about physics”, while grammatically incorrect, are often
semantically inaccurate as well.  While the previous statement would commonly
be understood to mean the person posses no knowledge of physics, the actual
statement implies the opposite, that the preposition “I know nothing about
physics” is incorrect.  Certainly your teacher offered sound advice and one
would be wise to heed such instruction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
