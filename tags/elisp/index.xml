configuration. In my opinion, it is one of the all time best packages
available, along with &lt;a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/org-mode" target="_blank">org-mode&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/magit/magit" target="_blank">magit&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my most commonly used commands with projectile is helm-projectile. This
lets me locate any file in my project by pressing &lt;code>C-c p h&lt;/code>. Using the
narrowing abilities of helm, I can quickly filter the list of options to
exactly the one I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generate Daily Messages With Org Journal</title><link>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/11/17/generate-daily-messages-with-org-journal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 15:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/11/17/generate-daily-messages-with-org-journal/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the requirements of my job is to send out a daily message. This message
should summarize what I did the day before, and what I hope to accomplish for
the current day. At first, I would spend my day jumping from task to task, and
then the next morning, I would rack my brain to make sure I included all the
things I worked on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snippet Expansion with YASnippet</title><link>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/02/26/snippet-expansion-with-yasnippet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2013 11:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/02/26/snippet-expansion-with-yasnippet/</guid><description>&lt;p>Any editor worth its salt has some provision for text snippet
expansion. TextMate, Vim, and Sublime Text 2 all have this capability and Emacs
is certainly no exception. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with the concept of snippets,
the basic idea involves defining a keyword, which when followed with some
trigger (keyboard shortcut or menu option), replaces that keyword with some
predefined text. This functionality is a great boost to productivity as it
prevents the developer from having to manually type potentially hundreds or
thousands of lines of relatively boilerplate code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dancing Code Monkey</title><link>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/01/05/dancing-code-monkey/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2013 23:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/01/05/dancing-code-monkey/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few months ago, I started playing around with Emacs. For roughly six years
prior to that, I was a die-hard Vim fan. Vim will always hold a special place
in my heart, but I have grown to love Emacs. I&amp;rsquo;ll undoubtedly cover Emacs in
more detail, but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that for other posts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
