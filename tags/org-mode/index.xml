and versatile features of Emacs. Great for writing structured documents,
managing lists and planning, and for exporting those documents into a variety
of formats, it&amp;rsquo;s my go to tool for flexible, efficient editing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generate Daily Messages With Org Journal</title><link>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/11/17/generate-daily-messages-with-org-journal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 15:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/11/17/generate-daily-messages-with-org-journal/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the requirements of my job is to send out a daily message. This message
should summarize what I did the day before, and what I hope to accomplish for
the current day. At first, I would spend my day jumping from task to task, and
then the next morning, I would rack my brain to make sure I included all the
things I worked on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snippet Expansion with YASnippet</title><link>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/02/26/snippet-expansion-with-yasnippet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2013 11:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/02/26/snippet-expansion-with-yasnippet/</guid><description>&lt;p>Any editor worth its salt has some provision for text snippet
expansion. TextMate, Vim, and Sublime Text 2 all have this capability and Emacs
is certainly no exception. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with the concept of snippets,
the basic idea involves defining a keyword, which when followed with some
trigger (keyboard shortcut or menu option), replaces that keyword with some
predefined text. This functionality is a great boost to productivity as it
prevents the developer from having to manually type potentially hundreds or
thousands of lines of relatively boilerplate code.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
