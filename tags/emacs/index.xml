      <title>A Look at Vim and Emacs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 26th, 2015 my friend Jacob and I presented to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://devict.org/&#34;&gt;DevICT&lt;/a&gt; on what we love about our editors of choice.
Jacob covered vim and I spoke about emacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this talk was billed as a head-to-head competition, neither Jacob nor I
had any intention of &amp;ldquo;battling it out&amp;rdquo;.  Instead, we wanted to focus on what we
thought each editor excelled at, and what we in particular liked about
them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Invalidate Projectile Cache on Delete</title>
      <link>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2014/10/06/invalidate-projectile-cache-on-delete/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile&#34;&gt;Projectile&lt;/a&gt; is a staple of my emacs
configuration.  In my opinion, it is one of the all time best packages
available, along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jwiegley/org-mode&#34;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/magit/magit&#34;&gt;magit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my most commonly used commands with projectile is helm-projectile.  This
lets me locate any file in my project by pressing &lt;code&gt;C-c p h&lt;/code&gt;.  Using the
narrowing abilities of helm, I can quickly filter the list of options to
exactly the one I want.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Performing Controlled PHP Refactorings in Emacs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By day, I work as a PHP developer at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://researchsquare.com&#34;&gt;Research Square&lt;/a&gt;.  My time is spent developing new
functionality for the RS suite of products.  This may include working in
greenfield code bases or extending our legacy products.  In either case, dozens
of times a day, I find myself performing various code refactorings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Embedding Code Snippets in Org Mode</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, &lt;a href=&#34;http://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;Org Mode&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most impressive
and versatile features of Emacs.  Great for writing structured documents,
managing lists and planning, and for exporting those documents into a variety
of formats, it&amp;rsquo;s my go to tool for flexible, efficient editing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Generate Daily Messages With Org Journal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the requirements of my job is to send out a daily message. This message
should summarize what I did the day before, and what I hope to accomplish for
the current day. At first, I would spend my day jumping from task to task, and
then the next morning, I would rack my brain to make sure I included all the
things I worked on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Snippet Expansion with YASnippet</title>
      <link>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/02/26/snippet-expansion-with-yasnippet/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2013 11:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/02/26/snippet-expansion-with-yasnippet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any editor worth its salt has some provision for text snippet
expansion. TextMate, Vim, and Sublime Text 2 all have this capability and Emacs
is certainly no exception. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with the concept of snippets,
the basic idea involves defining a keyword, which when followed with some
trigger (keyboard shortcut or menu option), replaces that keyword with some
predefined text. This functionality is a great boost to productivity as it
prevents the developer from having to manually type potentially hundreds or
thousands of lines of relatively boilerplate code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dancing Code Monkey</title>
      <link>https://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/01/05/dancing-code-monkey/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I started playing around with Emacs.  For roughly six years
prior to that, I was a die-hard Vim fan.  Vim will always hold a special place
in my heart, but I have grown to love Emacs. I&amp;rsquo;ll undoubtedly cover Emacs in
more detail, but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that for other posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
