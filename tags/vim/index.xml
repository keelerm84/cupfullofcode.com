      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 26th, 2015 my friend Jacob and I presented to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://devict.org/&#34;&gt;DevICT&lt;/a&gt; on what we love about our editors of choice.
Jacob covered vim and I spoke about emacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this talk was billed as a head-to-head competition, neither Jacob nor I
had any intention of &amp;ldquo;battling it out&amp;rdquo;.  Instead, we wanted to focus on what we
thought each editor excelled at, and what we in particular liked about
them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
