&lt;a href="http://devict.org/" target="_blank">DevICT&lt;/a> on what we love about our editors of choice.
Jacob covered vim and I spoke about emacs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this talk was billed as a head-to-head competition, neither Jacob nor I
had any intention of &amp;ldquo;battling it out&amp;rdquo;. Instead, we wanted to focus on what we
thought each editor excelled at, and what we in particular liked about
them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
