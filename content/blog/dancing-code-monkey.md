A few months ago, I started playing around with Emacs.  For roughly six years
prior to that, I was a die-hard Vim fan.  Vim will always hold a special place
in my heart, but I have grown to love Emacs. I'll undoubtedly cover Emacs in
more detail, but I'll leave that for other posts.<!--more-->

One cannot use Emacs for long without dabbling in Elisp, the language upon
which Emacs is built.  Having only briefly touched on Lisp languages in
college, I figured it was high time to start the learning process.

Recently, a friend of mine stumbled upon this cute little code monkey on
someone's Stackoverflow profile.

{{< highlight text >}}
          __
     w  c(..)o  (
      \__(-)   __)
          /\  (
         /( )__)
        m /|
         | \
         m  m
{{< / highlight >}}

Quite naturally I thought, "I should make him dance."  As this seemed
relatively simple, I decided to tackle this with Elisp.

I first created four slightly altered copies of the little guy, and with the
code shown below, had him dancing in no time.  You can make him dance
interactively a set number of times by issuing the standard prefix arguments
prior to invoking the function ( e.g. C-u 100 M-x dance-monkey ) or watch him
shake his groove thing on YouTube.

{{< highlight lisp >}}
(defun insert-monkey (num)
  (interactive "P")
  (erase-buffer)
  (insert-file-contents 
    (concat "/home/keelerm/Projects/emacs/code-monkey/" (int-to-string num))))

(defun dance-monkey (repeat)
  (interactive "P")
  (let ((times 0))
    (while (< times repeat)
      (insert-monkey (mod times 4))
      (setq times (1+ times))
      (sit-for 0.2)
      )))
{{< / highlight >}}

As stated above, I know this is extremely simple, but I suppose everyone has to
start somewhere.  Besides, who doesn't love a dancing monkey?
