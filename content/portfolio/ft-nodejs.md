The find.torrent service is a fantastic project, but on its own, it isn't very
useful. There must be an application built to manipulate it's API.

ft-nodejs is a node.js project built to do exactly this. Using node.js, the
jade templating engine, and socket.io, it providers a simple, clean interface
to search for torrents from a variety of devices.
