{{< figure src="/images/portfolio/gitlist.png" >}}

gitlist was built to be a modern web interface for multiple git repositories,
using some of the latest frameworks, including Silex and Twig, with Twitter
bootstrap for the design.

I have contributed a few patches to this project, such as better handling for
raw resource viewing and correcting paths to various commit objects.
