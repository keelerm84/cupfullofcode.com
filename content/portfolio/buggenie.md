{{< figure src="/images/portfolio/buggenie.png" >}}

The BugGenie was the first open source project I contributed to. It is an easy
to use issue tracking / project management system, written in PHP.

I have contributed various improvements, including fixing invalid links on
generated emails, inappropriate handling of various ajax requests, and a
variety of CSS based improvements.
