{{< figure src="/images/portfolio/emacs.png" >}}

Developers love their editors.  Typically, they love one to the exclusion of
all others.  But this is definitely not the case with me.  In fact, you might
say I have an editor addiction, having played with vim, Sublime Text, Eclipse,
Netbeans, and of course emacs.

My emacs configuration includes elisp code to perform auto installation and
updating upon start up, as well as customizations to various packages.
