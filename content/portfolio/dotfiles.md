What developer's github account would be complete without a dotfiles repo?

My dotfiles repository is structured to work with
[homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick), a bash based management
system for maintaing your .dotfiles.  It includes the configurations for the
tools I use most often, such as vim, tmux, zsh and irssi.
