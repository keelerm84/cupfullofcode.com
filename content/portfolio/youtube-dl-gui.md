The wildly popular youtube-dl python script is an excellent tool
for downloading and converting YouTube videos.  While it is an
awesome tool, it isn't the most user friendly tool for some people.

To make using it easier for my wife, I developed a cross-platform
C++ QT GUI that drives the command line utility.  Files can be
downloaded as video only, audio only, or as both, and automatically
converted into a variety of formats.
