          I've had the pleasure of working with Matthew for four years now,
          Matthew is a well spoken individual, skilled database
          administrator/programmer, and an excellent web application developer,
          utilizing PHP5. He is also a good Unix shell programmer, utilizing his
          skills to automate various tasks that are required when needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without a doubt in my mind, Matthew is the fastest learner I've had the
          pleasure to work with, being able to pick up new languages and technologies is
          short order.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy all the conversations I had with Matthew when brain storming
          together. I also enjoy playing ping-pong ("table tennis") with him.

          I worked with Matthew as a supervisor in the market research industry and I
          can honestly say that I could not have asked for a better leader. He always
          strove to be fair, consistent, and creative in his management
          practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          More importantly Matthew has been a great boon to my growth and development
          in the IT world. There has never been a question of mine that Matthew was not
          willing or able to answer; his technical knowledge is outstanding. We have
          worked together informally on several projects and have developed great
          synergy.

          I had the distinct pleasure of working with (and learning from) Mr. Keeler
          while we were both studying CS and math at Emporia. We've kept in touch
          since. Of those I've worked with, either in an academic or business setting,
          Matt is among the very best. When I recently found myself looking for a
          collaborator on a project, he was the first name that came to mind. He has an
          exceedingly sharp grasp of concepts, and has both technical skills, as well as
          being an excellent person to carry a conversation with. He would be a good
          choice to manage staff, or deal with interpersonal issues. He would be a
          definite asset to any organization, in a number of key roles.
