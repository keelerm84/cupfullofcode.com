    Below are some of the projects I have worked on.  This includes personal
    projects, open source contributions, and work done for various clients.
    The languages used include, but are not limited to PHP, Ruby, C++ and
    Node.js.

        The BugGenie was the first open source project I contributed to.
        It is an easy to use issue tracking / project management system,
        written in PHP.

      <p>
        I have contributed various improvements, including fixing invalid
        links on generated emails, inappropriate handling of various ajax

        exclusion of all others.  But this is definitely not the case with
        me.  In fact, you might say I have an editor addiction, having
        played with vim, Sublime Text, Eclipse, Netbeans, and of course
        emacs.

        a PHP based REST application, written using the BulletPHP
        framework, and using the HAL specification.

      <p>
        With this service, you can easily search for torrents from a

      <p>
        The find.torrent service is a fantastic project, but on its own, it
        isn't very useful.  There must be an application built to
        manipulate it's API.
      </p>
      <p>
        ft-nodejs is a node.js project built to do exactly this.  Using
        node.js, the jade templating engine, and socket.io, it providers a
        simple, clean interface to search for torrents from a variety of
        devices.

        This is the first talk I presented to the UpFront Wichita
        developers group.  As an introduction to git, I cover the basics of
        initializing a repository, staging commits, performing resets, and

        In addition to working on the PHP backend, I have also worked
        extensively with the C++ embedded clocking device which performs
        fingerprint biometric validation.

        To make using it easier for my wife, I developed a cross-platform
