On Thursday, March 26th, 2015 my friend Jacob and I presented to
[DevICT](http://devict.org/) on what we love about our editors of choice.
Jacob covered vim and I spoke about emacs.

While this talk was billed as a head-to-head competition, neither Jacob nor I
had any intention of "battling it out".  Instead, we wanted to focus on what we
thought each editor excelled at, and what we in particular liked about
them.<!-- more -->

The talks are available on YouTube, as are all the previous talked by DevICT.
