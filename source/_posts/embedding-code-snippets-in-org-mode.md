Without a doubt, [Org Mode](http://orgmode.org/) is one of the most impressive
and versatile features of Emacs.  Great for writing structured documents,
managing lists and planning, and for exporting those documents into a variety
of formats, it's my go to tool for flexible, efficient editing.<!-- more -->

In the video below, I cover one small aspect of Org Mode; namely, the ability
to embed code snippets within your document.  I'll cover some of the problems
you will run into when first attempting to embed code, how to overcome them,
and some shortcuts that make the whole process much more streamlined.

Enjoy!
